The purpose of this app (app_test_hall) is showing the use of the :ref:`Hall Sensor Module <module_hall>`. For that, it implements a simple app that reads the output of a Hall Effect sensor and shows over **XScope** the velocity and absolute position. Over console, it will output the electrical position of your shaft.

* **Minimum Number of Cores**: 2
* **Minimum Number of Tiles**: 2

Quick How-to
============

1. `Assemble your SOMANET device <assembling_somanet_node>`.
2. Wire up your device. Check how at your specific hardware documentation. Connect your Hall sensor, power supply cable, and XTAG. Power up!
3. `Set up your XMOS development tools <getting_started_xmos_dev_tools>`_. 
4. Download and **import** (LINK TO TUTORIAL: IMPORTING SOMANET LIBRARIES) in your workspace the SOMANET Motor Control Library and its dependancies.
5. Open the **main.xc** within  the **app_test_hall**. Include the **board-support file according to your device** (LINK TO BOARD SUPPORT MODULE?). Also set the appropiate target in your Makefile. (LINK HOW TO SET YOUR RIGHT TARGET IN YOUR MAKEFILE)

   .. important:: Make sure the SOMANET Motor Control Library supports your SOMANET device. For that, check the **Hardware compatibility** section of the library. (LINK TO IT).

6. Again in your **main.xc**, set the configuration for your Hall Service. 

    .. code-block:: C

            on tile[IFM_TILE]:
            /* Hall Service */
            {
                HallConfig hall_config;
                hall_config.pole_pairs = 1;

                hall_service(hall_ports, hall_config, i_hall);
            }

    .. note:: Do not worry if you don't know how many pole pairs your motor has. You can always run the application and see on the **console outputs** how many **electrical revolutions** are contained in a mechanical motor revolution. **This number is the number of pole pairs in your motor**.

7. Run the application enabling XScope (LINK TO TUTORIAL HOW TO RUN SOMANET APPLICATIONS)
