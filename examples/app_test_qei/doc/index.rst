The purpose of this app is showing the use of the :ref:`Encoder Interface Module <module_qei>`. For that, it implements a simple app that reads the output of an Encoder sensor and shows over **XScope** the read velocity and position.

Min. Nr. of cores: **2**.
Min. Nr. of tiles: **2**.

Quick how-to
============
1. **Assemble your SOMANET device** (LINK TO TUTORIAL PAGE).
2. **Wire up your device** (LINK TO INTERFACING YOUR SOMANET). Connect your Encoder sensor, power supply cable, and XTAG. Power up!
3. Set up your development environment by installing xTIMEcomposer. (LINK TO TUTORIAL OR TO XMOS TUTORIAL)
4. Download and **import** (LINK TO TUTORIAL: IMPORTING SOMANET LIBRARIES) in your workspace the SOMANET Motor Control Library and its dependancies.
5. Open the **main.xc** within  the **app_test_qei**. Include the **board-support file according to your device** (LINK TO BOARD SUPPORT MODULE?) and set the configuration for your Encoder Service. 

.. code-block:: C

        on tile[IFM_TILE]:
        /* Quadrature Encoder sensor Service */
        {
                QEIConfig qei_config; 
                qei_config.signal_type = QEI_RS422_SIGNAL;              
                qei_config.index_type = QEI_WITH_INDEX;                 
                qei_config.ticks_resolution = 4000;                     
                qei_config.sensor_polarity = QEI_POLARITY_NORMAL;       

                qei_service(qei_ports, qei_config, i_qei);
        }


.. important:: Not all the SOMANET IFM DC boards support TTL Encoder output signals. Make sure your DC device support such configuration.

6. Run the application enabling XScope (LINK TO TUTORIAL HOW TO RUN SOMANET APPLICATIONS)
