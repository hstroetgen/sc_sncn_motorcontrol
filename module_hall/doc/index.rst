through a common interface.

How to use
==========

.. important:: We assume that you are using **SOMANET Base** and your app includes the required **board support** files for your SOMANET device.
          You might find useful the **Hall Sensor Test** example app, which illustrates the use of this module. 

Service Initialization
----------------------
First add all the **SOMANET Motor Control Library** modules to your app Makefile.

::

 USED_MODULES = module_hall etc etc

.. note:: Not all modules will be required, but when using a library it is recommended to include always all the contained modules. 
          This will help solving internal dependancy issues.

Include the Service header in your app

.. code-block:: C

 #include <hall_service.h>
