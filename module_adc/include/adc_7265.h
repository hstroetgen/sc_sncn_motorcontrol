/*  The AD7265 data-sheet refers to the following signals:-
 *      SCLK:           Serial Clock frequency (can be configured to between  4..16 MHz.)
 *      CS#:            Chip Select. Ready signal (Falling edge starts sample conversion)
 *      A[0..2]:        Multiplexer Select. Selects inputs to be sampled.
 *      SGL/DIFF:       Selects between Single-ended/Differential mode.
 *      RANGE:          Selects between 0..Vref and 0..2xVref.
 *      Vdrive:         Max. analogue voltage corresponding to Max. 12-bit sample (Hardwired to 3.3V)
 *      REF_SELECT: Selects internal/external ref. (Hardwired to 2.5V internal)
 *
 *  The S/W application needs to set A[0..2].
 *  In differential mode (SGl/DIFF = 0):
 *      A[0] selects between Fully/Pseudo Differential. We choose A[0] = 0 for Fully Differential.
 *      A[1,2] is dependant on the motor identifier, and selects between Motor ports V1/V3/V5
 *
 *  The AD7265 returns a sample with 12 active bits of data.
 *  For our configuration (SGL/DIFF=0, A[0]=0, RANGE=0), these bit are in 2's compliment format.
 *
 *  There can also be padding bits (of value zero) both before and after the active bits.
 *  For this application 14, 15, or 16-bit samples can be used.
 *  If timings are set up correctly, the padding bits are expected to be as follows:-
 *
 *  Total-Sample-Size   Pre-Pad(MSB)   Post-Pad(LSB)
 *  -----------------  --------------  -------------
 *      14                 2               0
 *      15                 2               1
 *      16                 2               2
