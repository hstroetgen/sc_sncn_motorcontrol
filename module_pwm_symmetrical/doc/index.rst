==============================
SOMANET Symmetrical PWM module
==============================

This module offers a service that generates PWM signals over the provided ports. These generated pulses can be
controlled by a client function. Two different versions of the service are available, one triggers a signal with
every generated pulse (required sometimes for proper ADC sampling) and the other one does not. 

These PWM signals are intended to control both high- and low-side switches of three H-brigdes. 
The three channels are center aligned which means that the outputs are symmetrical to the center of the pulses.

This module was originally created by XMOS and then reworked by Synapticon before being include into the SOMANET Motor Control Library.

How to use
==========

.. important:: We assume that you are using SOMANET Base and your app includes the required board support files for your hardware.
          You might find useful the **PWM Symmetrical Demo** example app, which illustrates the use of this module. 

Service Initialization
----------------------
First add the module to your app Makefile

::

 USED_MODULES = module_pwm_symmetrical module_board-support etc

Include the Service header in your app

.. code-block:: C

 #include <pwm_service.h>

Declare the channels for Service-Client communication.

::

 chan c_pwm_ctrl;

Configure the ports and clocks for your service. This configuration is defined within the **board support** files.

::

 PwmPorts pwm_ports = SOMANET_IFM_PWM_PORTS;

Add a new parallel core in your main app where the PWM Service will run.

::

 on tile[IFM_TILE]: pwm_service(pwm_ports, c_pwm_ctrl);

Using the Service
-----------------

Include the Service Client header in your app

.. code-block:: C

 #include <pwm_service_client.h>

Instanciate the shared control structure, array for the PWM target values. 
Initialize the communication calling **pwm_share_control_buffer_address_with_server**.
Then you can start updating your PWM outputs through client calls. 

.. code-block:: C

  on tile[IFM_TILE]: 
  {
        t_pwm_control pwm_ctrl;
        unsigned int pwm[3] = {0, 0, 0};  

        pwm_share_control_buffer_address_with_server(c_pwm_ctrl, pwm_ctrl);
        update_pwm_inv(pwm_ctrl, c_pwm_ctrl, pwm);
  }



.. note:: If you are interested in the use of the Triggered PWM Service, have a look at the **Torque Control Demo App**.
