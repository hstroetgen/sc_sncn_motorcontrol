SOMANET Symmetrical PWM module

This module offers a service that generates PWM signals over the provided ports. These generated pulses can be
controlled by a client function. Two different versions of the service are available, one triggers a signal with
every generated pulse (required sometimes for proper ADC sampling) and the other one does not. 

These PWM signals are intended to control both high- and low-side switches of three H-brigdes. 
The three channels are center aligned which means that the outputs are symmetrical to the center of the pulses.

This module was originally `created by XMOS and then forked`_ and maintained in a dedicated `repo by Synapticon`_.
Later on, it was moved into this Motor Control Library.

How to use
==========

.. note:: You might find useful the **PWM Symmetrical Demo** example app, which illustrates the use of this module. 


First add the module to your app Makefile

::

USED_MODULES = module_pwm_symmetrical etc etc

Include the header in your app

::

#include <pwm_service.h>
